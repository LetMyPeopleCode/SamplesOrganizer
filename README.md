# SamplesOrganizer

Like any developer, I couldn't find an app that does things the way I wanted it to, so I decided to build my own.

This app is to help musicians and producers go through their libraries of samples, loops, MIDI files, etc. and organize them. It's not going to do a bunch of AI organizing yet... it's basically like a playlist manager that lets you browse through a bunch of different folders, elect to add the sound files in a folder to your database, and then let you add metadata about each file. 

It's just supposed to be easier than me using Finder to double-click on a file and then try to move it into some new folder hierarchy... All the files stay where they are. I click a few buttons to tag it with terms my brain finds useful and I have a basic, searchable, organization system.

## Features for V1
Custom tags: for genre, bpm, source, or any word or phrase that makes sense for you.
Project tags & exports: Tag files to a project and then export an archive of the selected items.
Identify the license file for a sample/folder/collection: so you can include related licenses for the samples in a project. 

## Features in the mysterious future
Multiple collections: If you need to keep work and personal collections on the same machine and don't want to jumble them up.
Import/Export information for a shared folder
Add your user name to all your tags for shared folders
Add more file previewers
Add more automation to speed up reviewing files

## Forking Ideas
Fork this as a desktop video/audio jukebox with the sample categorization engine working as a playlist manager/editor for music and video collections with the ability to sync playlists to a device. (Not on the roadmap, but seems like something you could adapt this to do)
